There should be two collections

The first collection is the User, and the second should be conversations held by two users.

Each Conversation document holds an array called participants, that contains an objecy objects with the following structure

 [
    adam : {

            <document id>

            <creation date>

                }

    betty: {

           <document id>

           <creation date>


        }

    ]


    It is important to note that the array has to be sorted alphabetically, meaning the person whose name is alphabetically
    first is placed first int the array.


    When a  person first messages someone

        - A conversationDocument is made. A new creationDate is assigned to the conversationDocument, which is stored in
        conversationHistories.
